  <h1>About</h1>
<p>Going by the online handle Quackdoc, I have been around computers for just about all of my life, starting off with a windows 98 toshiba satellite I had very early exposure to windows. I remained using windows for a long time an avid user of Windows XP is where I spent most of my time gaming and playing on PCs. The first Linux operating system I used full for a prolonged period of time was actually Xebian, debian for the xbox. I had played with linux before, Slackware and Arch. However found the novelty of running linux on an xbox quite alluring.</p>
<p>This was actually what originally got me into using Linux full time on my personal PCs, I distro hopped tons, from ubuntu, knoppix, slack, suse etc. I tried most of the big distros and eventually found myself on arch. While I do still distro hop on my laptops and other miscelanious machines I primairly run arch on my home desktop.</p>
<p>At one point, I may have called myself a tech enthusiast. I don't really think this accurately describes me anymore. While I do still get excited about interesting new tech like upcomming riscv platforms, S76's cosmic DE and all sorts of stuff. I find myself more and more annoyed with computing as I go. I regularly switch between Windows and Linux. Because of this I am overly aware of the flaws in both. No matter what operating system I try, From Windows, ReactOS, Linux distros, Android and even OSX. I can't help but feel overly annoyed at little things that feel so wrong no matter where you go. This is largely the reason I have settled on Arch. I don't believe arch is the best OS, I just simply think it's the least worst.</p>
<p>In the end, Since I can't escape tech, I can at least try to make it as bearable as I can for myself. The blog I have will largely be about sharing small bits of information about the large variety of tech I stumble across. However I will from time to time post tutorials, Information about various tech, and other misc bits and bobs. I also plan on using this page to reccomend various projects and software collections I personally use to make the tech I use on a daily basis less painful to use.</p>
